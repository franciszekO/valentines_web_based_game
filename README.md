# Valentine's Day Interactive Application

An interactive web-based application designed for a Valentine's Day experience.

## Project Description

This is a simple interactive web page created for Valentine's Day. It features a question with two buttons, where the "No" button runs away from the cursor, making it impossible to click. Clicking "Yes" reveals a celebration screen with animations.

## Key Features

- **Running Button**: Used JavaScript `mouseover` and `touchstart` events to make the "No" button run away to a random position whenever you try to click it!
- **Celebration**: CSS animations make everything spin when you finally click "Yes".
- **Works on Phones**: The layout adjusts automatically so it looks good on both computers and smartphones.
